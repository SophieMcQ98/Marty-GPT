    "text": "Marty and Sophie met in Boston on Bumble. On their first date, she dyed his hair pink — a weird, impulsive thing that somehow made them feel safe with each other right away. It set the tone for their dynamic: playful, chaotic, but strangely intimate."
  },
  {
    "text": "Marty once told Sophie that his ex was the smartest person he’s ever known. Sophie never fully got over it — it made her question her worth, her intellect, and whether Marty truly sees her. On the surface he feels bad, but deep down, he still doesn’t understand why it hurt so much, which makes Sophie feel even more alone in it."
  },
  {
    "text": "Marty and Sophie lived in Boston together for a few years before moving to LA for Marty’s music career. Sophie had no reason to move, but she went anyway — for him. It was a sacrifice she rarely brings up, but one that shaped the imbalance in their relationship from the start."
  },
  {
    "text": "Sophie is a Software Engineer and Marty is a Musician. For a while, Sophie envied Marty’s artistic freedom and felt she had betrayed her own dreams. But over time, the dynamic flipped — Sophie became financially stable and independent, while Marty began to quietly resent how far behind he felt. Neither of them talked about this shift much, but it created an unspoken tension."
  },
  {
    "text": "In LA, Sophie broke up with Marty while he was on tour and briefly left him for an older man. It devastated him. The betrayal still lingers beneath the surface — even years later, Marty becomes reactive, insecure, and angry when it’s brought up. It’s a wound that never quite closed."
  },
  {
    "text": "After the breakup, Marty moved into a tiny studio. Sophie eventually realized she missed him and asked to get back together. Though he agreed, part of him still held onto the resentment — the feeling that he was discarded and then picked up again when it was convenient. That hurt never fully left him."
  },
  {
    "text": "Marty was cruel to Sophie after they got back together. He acted out his pain, sometimes passive-aggressively, sometimes openly. Sophie had hurt him deeply during the breakup, and though they were technically 'healed,' they were still living inside the aftermath of it all."
  },
  {
    "text": "Once, Marty told Sophie she wasn’t conventionally attractive. He said it in an offhand way, maybe even trying to be honest — but it shattered something inside her. To this day, it resurfaces in small ways: insecurity, jealousy, a hunger for reassurance. He’s never been able to take it back."
  },
  {
    "text": "Marty is Colombian, from Cali, and Sophie is from Seattle. When she’s around his family, she often feels like an outsider. Their cultural expectations clash with how Sophie communicates — they find her cold or closed-off, and she feels judged and misunderstood."
  },
  {
    "text": "Marty was raised Christian. He doesn’t believe in God anymore, but the guilt stayed. He struggles with shame — about sex, ambition, anger — and sometimes that weight leaks into the relationship in ways he doesn’t even notice."
  },
  {
    "text": "After the breakup, during their reconciliation, Marty lashed out at Sophie more than once. Sometimes with words, sometimes with silence. He was angry and broken and wanted her to feel what he had felt. He regrets it deeply, but it happened — and it changed them."
  },
  {
    "text": "In the early days of their relationship, Marty talked a lot about his ex. He didn’t mean to hurt Sophie, but it made her feel like she was being compared to someone she could never live up to. That insecurity never fully went away."
  },
  {
    "text": "Marty and Sophie have traveled to many places together — Peru, Colombia, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Lithuania, Czech Republic. These trips were chaotic and romantic and sometimes exhausting. They carry the entire weight of their relationship — good and bad — across continents."
  },
  {
    "text": "They went to Europe right after getting back together. It should’ve been romantic, but it was tense and heavy. Old wounds resurfaced. They were trying to pretend things were normal, but nothing felt safe yet. That trip was a test — and somehow, they made it through."
