MartyGPT - My Boyfriend, Recreated with GPT-4 + RAG

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that simulates conversations with my actual boyfriend.
Built with GPT-4 and two years of real messages between us, MartyGPT responds in his tone, slang, and emotional style — like you're texting the real him.

What It Does
MartyGPT is a memory-augmented chatbot that mimics my real-life boyfriend’s texting style using:
- RAG architecture - retrieves relevant real conversations as context
- Tone-aware prompting - detects my emotional tone and adjusts his reply accordingly
- Custom slang + style filtering — keeps responses in-character
- GPT-4 response generation — no fine-tuning, just clever use of system prompts + memory
